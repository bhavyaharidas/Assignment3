Lending Club is a peer to peer lending company based in the United States, where investors provide funds for potential borrowers to earn a profit depending on the risk they take Lending Club provides acts as the platform between investors and borrowers.

Our case study is an implementation to predict the interest rates of loans disbursed  by The Lending club. We are using the Kaggle Lending club dataset.

1)	We have analyzed the clients needs and  explored the statistics presented by the Lending club as well to present the  insights for the client Bipa.
2)	We have performed feature engineering on the dataset to obtain multiple features
3)	On the cleaned data set we have applied the 3 ML models: Linear Regression  , Random Forest , Neural Network Model. The MAPE analysis is presented on the models in order to choose the best model
4)	The built models are tuned by applying the hyper-parameter optimization techniques. 
5)	Also AutoML  modelling is implemented on the Lending club data and is compared with the manual ML models
6)	Test cases are used to run on the models in order to predict the interest rate
