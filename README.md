Lending Club is a peer to peer lending company based in the United States, where investors provide funds for potential borrowers to earn a profit depending on the risk they take Lending Club provides acts as the platform between investors and borrowers.

We have analyzed the Lending club data and predicted the interest rate using 3 ML models : Linear Regression , Random Forest , Neural Network .  We infer  that among the three models the neural network model gives the best MAPE of  6.7%.  Also , there is an alternate AutoML model  AutoSK used to predict the interest rates. This gives us the accuracy of 99%. The model can be extended to predict returns. Our analysis showed that majority of the investments in Lending Club is in re-finance . This is an assures that lower interest rate loans can be borrowed and re-invested in higher returns domains within and beyond Lending Club
